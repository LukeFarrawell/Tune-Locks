When in game, Escape will take you back to the main menu 
O will be the previous level

Enter will reset the level



## How to Play! 

Each purple tile has a tune to it, and so does every door (brown tile). 

You must find the same tune purple tile as the door. 

More difficult levels may have 2 tune tiles, BUT you only need to press one of them. 

The tunes are randomly set to a purple tile each reload of the same level (but the purple tiles stay in the same place) but is coded to make sure the Tune Tile and the Door Tile have the exact same tune, the Key tune will not be generated on the non key Tune Tiles. 

The door is only unlocked once the Tune is pressed, and if the door hears a different Tune, it will be immediately locked.
